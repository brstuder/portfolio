From 2019 to 2020 I worked as an undergraduate intern for the AbbVie Innovation Center in UIUC's Research Park. As a Digital Communication Intern, I would design and write articles about healthcare technology as well as internal newsletters. For my summer project, I helped overhaul internal onboarding guides in Microsoft Sharepoint for AbbVie team members. Albeit somewhat blurry, the attached screenshot will provide a glimpse into that content (I am unable to share it in its entirety for proprietary reasons).
