From 2019 to 2020 I worked as a Technical Writing Intern for the AbbVie Innovation Center in UIUC's Research Park, an office comprised of student interns helping full-time AbbVie staff remotely. I would draft and write articles about healthcare technology as well as internal newsletters, which involved face-to-face time with AbbVie staff for consultation and feedback. For my summer project, I helped overhaul company onboaring materials in Microsoft Sharepoint for AbbVie.

Albeit somewhat blurry, the attached screenshot will provide a glimpse into that content (I am unable to share it in its entirety for proprietary reasons).
